Starting from the node indicated as `start', use DFS and label the nodes with their ending times. Which of the alternatives below corresponds to a possible answer?

Tip: the reverse order of finishing DFS times in a directed acyclic graph is a topological order.

\subsection*{Answer: C}

The given digraph is acyclic, therefore the finishing time must form a topological sorting of its vertices.

For \textbf{A.}, we have 18 as a successor to 19 in the topological order, but there's aa back arc from 18 to 19, invalidating this order.

For \textbf{B.}, there's an arc from 10 to 20. In fact, the start node must be the last with the largest finishing time.

For \textbf{C.}, the topological is valid:

For \textbf{D.}, the single invalid arc is from 8 to 12.
