Consider a Random Network such that $N = 1000$ and $p = 0.004$. We need to break apart its giant component, and the only way to do that is by randomly removing nodes. Under these conditions, how many nodes should we remove at minimum to have a good chance of achieving our goal?

\begin{enumerate}[label={\Alph*.}]
    \item 750
    \item 720
    \item 840
    \item 810
    \item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
