Consider a Random Network such that $N = 1000$ and $p = 0.004$. We need to break apart its giant component, and the only way to do that is by randomly removing nodes. Under these conditions, how many nodes should we remove at minimum to have a good chance of achieving our goal?

\begin{enumerate}[label={\Alph*.}]
    \item 750
    \item 720
    \item 840
    \item 810
    \item None of the above
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Answer: A}

Using the Binomal distribution, we have \[
    \langle k \rangle = p (N - 1) = 3.996
\] And \[
    \left\langle k^2 \right\rangle = p (1-p) (N-1) + p^2 (N-1)^2 = 19.948
\]

Therefore, the critical threshold as given by the Molloy-Reed criterion is
\begin{align*}
    f_c &= 1 - \frac{1}{\frac{\left\langle k^2 \right\rangle}{\left\langle k \right\rangle} - 1} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{1}{\frac{19.948}{3.996} - 1} \\
    &= 0.7495
\end{align*}

Then the giant component should start to break apart after $f_c \cdot N = 749.5$ nodes are removed.
