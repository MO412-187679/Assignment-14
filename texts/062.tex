Given two networks G1 and G2 generated by the Barab√°si-Albert model with $N = 1000$ and $N = 100$ nodes, respectively, find out which network likely has the smallest diameter. Also, give their expected diameters, rounded to two decimal places.

\begin{enumerate}[label={\Alph*.}]
    \item G1 has the smallest diameter, 6.29, while G2 has diameter 6.64
    \item G2 has the smallest diameter, 3.02, while G1 has diameter 3.57
    \item G1 has the smallest diameter, 3.22, while G2 has diameter 5.44
    \item G2 has the smallest diameter, 5.31, while G1 has diameter 5.44
    \item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
