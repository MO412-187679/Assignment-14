Given two networks G1 and G2 generated by the Barabási-Albert model with $N = 1000$ and $N = 100$ nodes, respectively, find out which network likely has the smallest diameter. Also, give their expected diameters, rounded to two decimal places.

\begin{enumerate}[label={\Alph*.}]
    \item G1 has the smallest diameter, 6.29, while G2 has diameter 6.64
    \item G2 has the smallest diameter, 3.02, while G1 has diameter 3.57
    \item G1 has the smallest diameter, 3.22, while G2 has diameter 5.44
    \item G2 has the smallest diameter, 5.31, while G1 has diameter 5.44
    \item None of the above
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Answer: B}

For a Barabási-Albert network $G$ with $m \geq 2$ there is a real number $\epsilon > 0$ such that the diameter $d_{\max}(G)$ of the network is bounded by \[
    (1 - \epsilon) \frac{\ln N}{\ln \ln N} \leq d_{\max}(G) \leq (1 + \epsilon) \frac{\ln N}{\ln \ln N}
\] \cite{diameter}

~

Therefore, if we assume $m > 1$, we can approximate $d_{\max}(G) \approx \ln N / \ln \ln N$. Then
\begin{gather*}
    d_{\max}(\text{G1})
        \approx \frac{\ln N(\text{G1})}{\ln \ln N(\text{G1})}
        = \frac{\ln 1000}{\ln \ln 1000}
        = \frac{6.907}{1.933}
        = 3.574
    \\
    d_{\max}(\text{G2})
        \approx \frac{\ln N(\text{G2})}{\ln \ln N(\text{G2})}
        = \frac{\ln 100}{\ln \ln 100}
        = \frac{4.605}{1.527}
        = 3.015
\end{gather*}
